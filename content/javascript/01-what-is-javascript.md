## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that brings interactivity to your website. If HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the appearance, JavaScript is the brain that makes things happen.

### Core Features of JavaScript

-   It's one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
-   It can dynamically update and change both HTML and CSS.
-   It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
-   It's used for things like interactive forms, animations, and fetching data from other websites.

A classic first program in any language is "Hello, World!". In JavaScript, you can write it like this to print to the browser's console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Learning it is essential for modern web development.
