## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. If HTML provides the structure (the skeleton) and CSS the styling (the clothes), JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality (the brain and muscles).

### What can JavaScript do?

-   **Manipulate the DOM**: Dynamically update and change both HTML and CSS. You can change content, styles, and attributes in response to user actions.
-   **Handle Events**: React to user events like clicks, mouse movements, keyboard presses, and more.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Fetch data from servers (using APIs), update parts of a page without a full reload (AJAX), and handle time-consuming operations without freezing the browser.
-   **Data Validation**: Validate user input in forms before sending it to a server.
-   **And much more**: Create animations, manage state, build complex single-page applications (SPAs), and even power servers (with Node.js).

### Running JavaScript

You can run JavaScript directly in your web browser's developer console. To open it, right-click on a webpage, select "Inspect", and then click on the "Console" tab.

Try typing this and pressing Enter:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This will print the message "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Exercises

1.  **Use the Console**: Open the developer console on any webpage.
2.  **Perform a calculation**: Type `2 + 2` and press Enter. The console will work like a calculator and show you the result.
3.  **Display an alert**: Type `alert("Hello from JavaScript!");` and press Enter. You should see a pop-up dialog box.
4.  **Create a simple script**: Create an HTML file and add a `<script>` tag at the bottom, just before the closing `</body>` tag. Inside the script, add the `console.log` and `alert` commands from above. Open the HTML file in your browser and see both actions execute.
