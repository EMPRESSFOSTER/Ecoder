## What is CSS?

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. If HTML is the skeleton of a webpage, CSS is the clothing and appearance. It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

### What can CSS do?

-   You can change the color, font, and size of text.
-   You can add borders and backgrounds.
-   You can position elements on the page.
-   It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
-   It allows for responsive design, making your site look good on all devices.

Here's a small CSS snippet that makes all paragraphs red:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```
