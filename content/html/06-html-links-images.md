## Links and Images

Links and images are essential for creating rich, interconnected web content.

### Links

The HTML `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink. The `href` attribute is the most important attribute of the `<a>` tag, and it indicates the link's destination.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

### Images

The HTML `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in a web page. It is an empty tag, meaning it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image, and the `alt` attribute provides an alternate text.

```html
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" width="42" height="42">
```
