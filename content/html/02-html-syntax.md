## HTML Syntax

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

```html
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

### Nested Elements

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (`<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
