## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of a webpage.

### Key Points:

-   HTML describes the **structure** of a Web page.
-   It consists of a series of **elements**.
-   HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
-   Elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

Here is a simple example of an HTML element:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
