## What is HTML?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of a webpageâ€”it provides the fundamental structure and content.

### What does it do?

-   HTML describes the **structure** of a Web page using markup.
-   HTML consists of a series of **elements**, which are the building blocks of HTML pages.
-   HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
-   Elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

A simple HTML document looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>My First Heading</h1>
  <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

### Key Terms

-   **HyperText**: Text which contains links to other texts.
