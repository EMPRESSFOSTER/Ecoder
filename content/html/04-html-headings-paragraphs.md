## Headings and Paragraphs

Headings and paragraphs are fundamental for structuring text content on a webpage.

### Headings

HTML offers six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. `<h1>` is the most important heading, and `<h6>` is the least. Search engines use headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subheading</h3>
```

### Paragraphs

The `<p>` element defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
```
